In this assignment, we implemened an UI for HW2 with a dynamic approach that uses asynchronous JavaScript requests 
to send the user-inputted data to the ReST API we already built,and  published  them into the page without refreshing the whole page again.
We create a web application which takes Date as input  from the user.
Here , weather forecast for five days from the given date  is displayed in the form of graph.
Weather Forecast Bonus: The weather forecast is hosted for five days.Data is plotted from using data from API.
